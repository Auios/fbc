This file name got your attention, eh? Anyway, FB really needs your help,
let's start:

1) We need documentation about the syntax, about the statements and 
intrinsic functions, about the command-line (really??), about well, everything
is missing.

2) We need help porting/translating the headers from the Win API (it's better to 
put each function on it's own header (like kernel32, user32, etc), or else the include 
file can get easily >1MB), the Gtk+ headers, plus finishing GLUT and others headers 
from the Directx SDK like D3D etc, etc.. any header from a known C API is welcome.

3) Writing tests, making demos, reporting bugs (use the sourceforge's page, be the most
descriptive you can, thanks). FB is just a few months old, many tests are needed yet.

4) Anything i forgot..


If you can REALLY help on any of the items listed above, contact me at 
av1ctor@yahoo.com.br, you will get the full credits for any contribution, thanks.
