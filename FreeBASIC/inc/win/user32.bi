'This header defines every obtainable user32 Function and related data types and structures.

'VERSION: 1.08

'Changelog:
'  1.08: NMHDR moved back, comdlg must include this header
'        all constants copied from winuser.h, so nothing should be missing now -- many structs still left
'  1.07: STRING types changed to BYTE PTR for structs fields and function results (v1ctor)
'  1.06: Added new stuff for listboxes, scrollbars, and static controls.
'  1.05: Added function constants for the combobox control.
'  1.04: NMHDR moved into winbase.bi for future compatibility with comdlg32.bi.
'  1.03: new button style constants. Added the HELPINFO Type. Transmigrated to WINBASE.BI for simplicity by fsw's request.
'        Moved type SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES into WINBASE.BI.
'  1.02: Rewrote the preprocessor directives so they'd actually WORK. :) Removed unneeded constants.
'  1.01: uses 0.08's new preprocessor to include win32constants.bi and win32types.bi, this makes shared constants and
'        types across multiple API inclusions a breeze :)

'$include once: "win\winbase.bi"
