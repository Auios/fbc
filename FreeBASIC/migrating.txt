    Since version 0.17 FreeBASIC has a -lang command-line option, used to 
change the language compatibility mode.

	It was needed to let FB support object-orientation in future, without
crippling the QuickBASIC support, or breaking compatibility with old FB
sources, and without making FB difficult to maintain with n-different 
versions of pretty much the same packages. The QB support can be improved
now too, if needed, without breaking the sources written specifically for FB.

    To compile old GW-BASIC and QB(ASIC) sources without too many changes,
use "-lang qb" (without quotes) option in the command-line when running FBC.

    To compile 0.16 or below sources, use the "-lang deprecated" option.
    

    The differences between modes are:
    
    o fb (the default mode):
    
      Not supported:
      
      1) implicit variables
         - all variables must be always explicitly declared
      
      2) suffixes (! # $ % &), even for constants
         - use type-casting or the f (single), d (double), ll (longint), 
           ul (uinteger), ull (ulongint) suffix with constants to resolve 
           overloading
      
      3) DEF###, so there's no implicit types
         - AS is always needed when declaring *any* symbol but CONST's, 
           where types are inferred
      
      4) default BYREF parameters
         - all parameters are passed by value (BYVAL) by default 
         - use the "-w pedantic" command-line option to get paramaters 
           without explicit BYREF or BYVAL reported
      
      5) OPTION's of any kind (no context-sensitivity)
         - instead of NOKEYWORD, use #undef
         - instead of ESCAPE, use: !"some esc seq \n\r" (notice the '!' char)
           and pass "-w pedantic" to check for possible escape sequences
         - EXPLICIT isn't needed, see item 1
         - BYVAL isn't needed, see item 4
         - instead of DYNAMIC, use REDIM to create dynamic arrays, or 
           declare them with empty subcripts: DIM array() AS sometype
         - instead of BASE, use explicit lbound subcripts in arrays
         - instead of PRIVATE, declare each function as PRIVATE
      
      6) periods in symbol names 
         - use namespaces instead
     
      7) GOSUB/RETURN 
         - nested functions may be allowed in future
      
      8) ON .. GOSUB|GOTO 
         - use SELECT expr AS CONST for the latter
      
      9) ON ERROR | RESUME 
         - all statements can be used as functions to check for run-time 
           errors like:  IF OPEN( "text" FOR INPUT AS #1 ) <> 0 THEN error... 
      
     10) '$DYNAMIC, '$STATIC, '$INCLUDE meta-commands embedded in 
         comments
         - see item 5 about OPTION DYNAMIC
         - use #include "filename" instead of '$include
     
     11) CALL or LET
         - just remove them
     
     12) numeric labels
         - no comment
     
   
    o deprecated:
     
	  Supported: anything allowed in version 0.16, but: 
     
      1) GOSUB/RETURN and ON ... GOSUB (even at module-level)
         - so the GOSUB implementation could be thread-unsafe in the 
           "-lang qb" mode, allowing fast executation ("-lang qb" doesn't 
           support multi-threading, while "-lang deprecated" does)
     
      Not supported:
     
      1) Classes
         - periods allowed in symbols names make it too difficult and/or
           ambiguous
     
      2) Operator overloading
      	 - ditto
     
   
    o qb:
     
      Supported: Everything not supported/allowed in the fb mode, plus:
      
      1) CALL can be used with forward functions (W.I.P.)
     
      2) SHARED can be used inside functions   (W.I.P.)
     
      3) all variables, implicit or explicit, are always allocated in
         the function scope, as in QB
        
      4) ...
     
      Not supported:
     
      1) Multi-threading
         - the thread*, mutex* and cond* functions can't be used
     
      2) Classes and Namespaces
     
      3) Function and operator overloading
     
      4) SCOPE blocks
     
      5) EXTERN blocks
      
      6) Variable initializers
         - all variables are moved to the function scope (as in QB), 
           making local initializers too difficult to support
     
     
	The -lang qb and -lang deprecated options will always be supported in
future versions.
