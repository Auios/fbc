[ ] full debug support
    - when calling rt functions in module-level code, GDB will never step over them
    - add dynamic arrays - couldn't get GDB to use Fortran-like arrays
    - each overloaded function will show the locals of *ALL* functions
    - make ASSERT call a rtlib function (fb_Assert)
    - add ASSERT_WARN (fb_AssertWarn)
    - add bounds checking to all kinds of arrays - use IIF()
    - add null pointer checking - IIF() too?

[ ] pointers
    - passing pointers to byval strings w/o BYVAL is been allowed, show a warning (or error?)
    - is it okay to * ptr.type if ptr is at the right-side?

[ ] EMIT:
    - optimize load after store
    - re-ordering optimization if target cpu is +586

[ ] convert WITH to ptr and remove the lex hacking
    - then allow '->' too (.xxx will have to be converted to ->xxx anyways)

[ ] allow ENDIF too, it's supported by BC

[ ] function overloading
    - check arglist with optionals with different types at the same arg num (?)
    - check different modes and types if they are working
    - check optional args, this can be tricky

[ ] allow FB functions to return UDT's - must follow the GCC 3.x ABI

[ ] named field initializers: ( "foo" => bar, "udt" => ( 1, { 2, 3 }, 4 ) )
    - all fields initialized must be named as a special parser routine will have to be used,
      that will keep track of what wasn't initialized to fill 'em with 0's - static only, locals
      are already cleared

[ ] add the concatenation operator (&) as in VB/... - any type must be implicitly converted to string

[ ] add fix-len and zstring * support to arrays args passed by descriptor

*** *** *** *** ***
[ ] inline functions
    - better than macros as they can be "turned off" when debugged

[ ] classes
    - *MUST* follow the GCC 3.x ABI to make it easier to reuse C++ libs compiled by GCC
    - Java/Php5-ish syntax: CLASS EXTENDS IMPLEMENTS THROWS
    - single inheritance, plus interfaces
    - exceptions - with unwind support
    - operator overloading
    - pure virtual methods
    - down casting
    - name space
    - static constructors and destructors
    - some support for RTTI

*** future ***
[ ] AndAlso and OrElse, short-circuit versions of And and Or

[ ] unreachable code removal

[ ] use a DAG for common sub-expr opt (don't mess up w/ FPU??)
