fbdoc TODO list
---------------

[ ]	add proxy support to CHttp.

[ ]	add the insert/delete methods to CWiki to allow programmatic editing 
	of wakka script.

[ ] add an image getter using libCURL so the on-line images
	can be included in the CHM version of the docs.
	[ ] built-in support for image getting ( uses external tool currently )
	[ ] only include images in the HTML tarball that are actually referenced
	    by the doc pages
	[X] add support to CWakka2Html for images

[ ]	remove preservation of the TAB + "~" indentation.  only TAB is needed.
	- The "~" characters are preserved for now to allow easy testing of
	  recently added CWiki->Build() method.

[ ] improve format of keywords.lst so that it could be used as an input file
	to generate other files for editors that support syntax highlighting.

[ ] make the program more friendly to restricted user environments.  As-is,
	the data cache is located under the application directory.

[ ] Add the fbdoc 'tools'.  maybe need a seperate directory in /src/contrib?
	[ ] 'getindex [source]'
		retrieves PageIndex as a text file.  One page name per file
	[ ] 'getpage [source] [page] [@pagelist]'
		retrieves a single or multiple pages from on-line to ./fbdoc/cache.
	[ ] 'putpage [dest] [page] [@pagelist]'
		store a single or multiple pages from ./fbdoc/cache to on-line.
	[ ] 'chkdocs [options]'
		checks document links, missing pages, some formatting etc, and generates
		a report of possible problems needing attention in the documentation
	[ ] 'mkprntoc [options]'
		makes PrintToc page from wakka script sources
	[ ] 'renpage [oldname newname] [@list]'
		renames pages by updating referring links on all other pages.
		newpage/clone, and oldpage/delete still must be performed by a user.
	[ ] 'mkerrlst [options]'
		makes CompilerErrMsg from fbc sources
	[ ] 'getimagelist'
		scans wakka sources for the urls of images
	[ ] 'getimage filelist.txt'
		downloads images from urls to the html/images directory

[ ] Code clean-up
	[ ] refactor common code in CWakka2Html and CWakka2fbhelp
	[ ] refactor common code in CWiki2Chm, CWiki2Txt, and CWiki2fbhelp
	[ ] combine mkfbhelpfile.bas with CWiki2Txt and don't write out 100's of
		files during the build

[ ] Distribution
	[ ] add makefiles, scripts, a batchfile, ( anything ) to build all docs
	    from scratch and zip/gzip all files needed for distribution.

[ ] Documentation
	[ ] create documentation for fbdoc command line options
	[ ] create an overview of how fbdoc works
	[ ] create documentation for fbdoc library ( the library might change so
		this can't be overly complicated to maintain )
	[ ] create a CHM possibly using just the FBWiki* pages from the on-line
		docuentation

[ ] New emitters
	[ ] write the Texinfo emitter
	[ ] write the PDF emitter ( may require an intermediate format, or based
		on Texinfo output files )
