Overview of where and how to get started with FreeBASIC

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Introduction"}}
	FreeBASIC is a 32-bit compiler, open source and //[[GnuLicenses licensed under the GPL]]//. It is designed to be syntax compatible with QuickBASIC, while expanding on the language and capabilities. It compiles for DOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux, and is being ported to other platforms. See //[[CompilerAbout About FreeBASIC]]// and //[[CompilerFeatures Main Features]]//.

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Latest Version"}}
	FreeBASIC is a beta release compiler and development is ongoing.  With each full release, many features are added, and bugs from previous releases are fixed.  To see the latest version available, visit [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc http://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc]] on [[http://sourceforge.net SourceForge]], or [[http://www.freebasic.net/index.php/download http://www.freebasic.net/index.php/download]] on [[http://www.freebasic.net FreeBASIC's official website]].

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Requirements and Installation"}}
	See //[[CompilerRequirements Requirements]]// and //[[CompilerRequirements Installation]]//.

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Running"}}
	FreeBASIC is a compiler and as such is not packaged with an IDE, although there are a few IDE's available. For information on using FreeBASIC without an IDE, see //[[CompilerRunning Running]]//.

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Compatibility with QuickBasic"}}
	FreeBASIC is designed syntax compatible with QuickBASIC.  For best code-compatibility with QuickBASIC, the //[[CompilerDialects QB dialect]]// can be used when compiling source code. See //[[CompilerDialects FreeBASIC Dialects]]// and //[[LangQB Differences from QB]]//.

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Documentation"}}
	All official documentation can be found online in the wiki at [[http://www.freebasic.net/wiki http://www.freebasic.net/wiki]].  The online documentation is the primary source used for converting the FreeBASIC manual to other downloadable formats.  Whenever there is a discrepancy between a downloadable version of the manual and the online version, the online version can be regarded as the correct version.
