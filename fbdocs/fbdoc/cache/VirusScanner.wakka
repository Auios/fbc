Hi, I'm currently a freshman in high school (America). I started programming in 6th grade (3 years ago) and I'd say I know a fair amount, although you can never know everything. I use mainly IBasic Pro, but FreeBASIC is making much progress and seems like a great alternitive, as soon as I can easily compile projects from an IDE :) I'm working on it.

I'm interested in math and languages, I know bits of Turkish, Russian and Spanish, but I've also looked at Arabic, Portuguese, Japonese, etc. Unfortunately, I'm only fluent in English at the moment though. But keep studying... :)
