Control flow statement for looping

{{fbdoc item="syntax"}}##
	**For** //iterator// [ [[KeyPgAs as]] [[DataType datatype]] ] = //startvalue// **To** //endvalue// [ **Step** //stepvalue// ]
		[ //statement block// ]
	**Next** [ //iterator// ]
##
{{fbdoc item="param"}}
	##//iterator//##
		a variable identifier that is used to iterate from an initial value to an end value
	##//datatype//##
		If specified, the variable ##//iterator//## will automatically be declared with the type ##//datatype//##.
	##//startvalue//##
		an expression that denotes the starting value of the iterator
	##//endvalue//##
		an expression used to compare with the value of the iterator
	##//stepvalue//##
		an expression that is added to the iterator after every iteration

{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
	A ##**For...Next**## loop initializes //iterator// to //startvalue//, then executes the //statement block//'s, incrementing //iterator// by //stepvalue// until it reaches //endvalue//. If //stepvalue// is not explicitly given it will set to 1.

	The //iterator// may be defined having the same scope as the ##**For**## statement by using the ##[[KeyPgAs as]] [[DataType datatype]]## syntax.  With this syntax, //iterator// is created and destroyed within the ##**For...Next**## scope. See dialect differnces below.

	The ##**For**## statement causes the execution of the statements in the //statement block// until //iterator// compares **greater than** //endvalue//. //iterator// will be incremented the amount of //stepvalue// following each execution of the //statement block//. If an increment is not given, //iterator// will be implicitly incremented by 1.

	If //endvalue// is less than //startvalue// then a negative //stepvalue// must be specified or the //statement block// will not execute at all, since //startvalue// compares greater than //endvalue//.

	If an ##[[KeyPgExit Exit]]## ##**For**## statement is encountered inside the //statement block//, the loop is terminated, and execution resumes immediately following the enclosing ##**Next**## statement. If a ##[[KeyPgContinue Continue]]## ##**For**## statement is encountered, the rest of the //statement block// is skipped and execution resumes at the FOR statement.

	Like all control flow statements, the ##**For**## statement can be nested, ie., it can be used in a statement block of another FOR statement.

	After initial evaluation, the //increment// is stored internally, and thus cannot be changed for subsequent executions.

	//**note**: When a negative //increment// is specified, the ##**For**## statement loops until //iterator// compares //less than// //end_value//.//

	- In //-lang qb//, variables declared inside a FOR..NEXT loop have a function-wide [[ProPgVariableScope scope]]  as in QB 
	- In //-lang fb// or //-lang deprecated//, variables declared inside a FOR..NEXT block are visible only inside the block, and can't be accessed outside it.

	- BYREF arguments cannot be used as counters.
