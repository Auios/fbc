	Pointer indexing operator [] allows to adress the places contiguous to where a pointer points to. The memory position pointed to is //pointer_variable// +/- (//expression// * SIZEOF(*//pointed_variable//)). The pointer itself is not changed.

	Is up to the user to ensure the resulting pointer points to meaningful data.
