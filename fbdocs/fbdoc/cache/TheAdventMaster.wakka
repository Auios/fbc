I go by Pritchard on the FreeBASIC.net Forums.

I've been using FreeBASIC since .13 and can help with a variety of issues.  If you need anything, ask on the forum.  If you have an edit disagreement with me, make sure it's not because I edited "your" content you submitted to the wiki.  Wiki content's meant to be edited.  Deal with it.  Anywho, this page is so I can test Wiki changes and mockups without disrupting other pages.

Please don't edit this page,
Pritchard.
