	##**Any**## can be used in three contexts: pointers,variable initializers, pointer arguments of functions and function declarations to indicate an unknown data type.
	
	 A pointer defined as an **Any**ptr  disables the compiler checking for the type of data it points to. It is useful as it can point to different types of data. Before dereferencing it (accessing to the data it ponts to) it must be [[KeyPgCast CAST]] to a known data type.
	This should not be confused with ##Variant##, a Visual Basic data type which can contain any type of variable, which is not intrinsically supported by FreeBASIC.
	
	##**Any**## can be used as a  fake initializer to disable the default initialization to 0 of the variables. This may save time in critical sections of the programs. Is up to the program to fill the variables with significant data.
	
	**##Any##** can be used  in function  parameter lists with PTR arguments to allow the passing of any type of pointers. In this case the function must [[KeyPgCast CAST]] the pointer argument to a known data rype before accessing it.
	
	**##Any##** can be used  in function prototypes (in a ##[[KeyPgDeclare Declare]]## statement) with ##[[KeyPgByref ByRef]]## arguments to  disable the compiler checking for the correct type of the variable passed. This use of ANY is deprecated and it'¡s only there for compatibility with QB, where it was the only way of passing arrays as arguments.
