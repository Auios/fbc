Invoking the compiler after installation.

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Windows"}}
	A desktop icon and start-menu links should have been created by the installer, and can be used to open the console directly into the directory where FreeBASIC was installed - ##C:\Program Files\FreeBASIC## by default. Alternatively, using the console ("MS-DOS prompt"), navigate to the directory where FreeBASIC was installed.

	At the prompt, type,

		##fbc##

	to see a list of options. To compile the "Hello, world!" example program type,

		##fbc examples\hello.bas##

	and a ##hello.exe## executable file will be created in the ##examples## directory.

{{fbdoc item="section" value="Linux"}}
	If the install script ##install.sh## was successfully executed with enough privileges, a link to the compiler binary should have been created at ##/usr/bin/fbc##, allowing any user access to the compiler from any directory. If it was not possible to create the link, you may want to alter your ##PATH## environmental variable to be able to invoke the compiler from any directory. Navigate to the directory where FreeBASIC was installed.

	From the prompt, type,

		 ##fbc##

	to see a list of options. To compile the "Hello, world!" example program type,

		##fbc examples/hello.bas##

	and a ##./hello## executable file will be created in the ##examples## directory.


{{fbdoc item="section" value="DOS"}}
	Navigate to the directory where FreeBASIC was installed. For example, if FreeBASIC is installed in the directory ##C:\FB##, type,

		##C:##
		##CD FB##

	Some DOSes accept "##CDD C:\FB##" as well. You can also add the FreeBASIC directory to your PATH environment variable (usually something like "##SET PATH=C:\FB\;%PATH%##") so you can invoke the compiler from any directory.

	At the prompt, type,

		##fbc##

	to see a list of options. To compile the "Hello, world!" example program type,

		##fbc examples\hello.bas##

	and a ##hello.exe## executable file will be created in the ##examples## directory.
