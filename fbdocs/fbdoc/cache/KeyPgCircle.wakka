	**Circle** [//target//,] [STEP] (x,y), radius[, [color][, [start][, [end][, [aspect][, F]]]]]

	##//radius//##
		radius	
	##//color//##
		the color attribute.

	##**Circle**## will draw a circle, ellipse, or arc based on the parameters given to it. 

	##//target//## specifies buffer to draw on.  ##//target//## may be an image created with ##[[KeyPgImagecreate Imagecreate]]## or ##[[KeyPgGetgraphics Get (Graphics)]]##.  If omitted, ##//target//## defaults to the screen's current work page.  (See ##[[KeyPgScreenset Screenset]]##)

	The center of the shape will be placed on the destination surface at ##(//X//,//Y//)##. Radius denotes the radius of the shape. 

	##//Color//## denotes the colour attribute, which is mode specific (see ##[[KeyPgColor Color]]## and ##[[KeyPgScreengraphics Screen (Graphics)]]## for details). If omitted, the current foreground color as set by the ##[[KeyPgColor Color]]## statement is used.

	The ##STEP## option specifies that ##//X//## and ##//Y//## are offsets relative to the current graphics cursor position.

	##//start//## and ##//end//## are angles are in ##[[ProPgRadians radians]]##. These can range -2PI to 2PI; if you specify a negative angle, its value is changed sign and a line is drawn from the center up to that point in the arc. End angle can be less than start angle. If you do not specify start and end, a full circle/ellipse is drawn; if you you specify start but not end, end is assumed to be 2PI; if you specify end but not start, start is assumed to be 0.

	##//aspect//## is the aspect ratio, or the ratio of the y radius over the x radius. The default value is the value required to draw a perfect circle on the screen, keeping pixel aspect ratio in mind. This value can be calculated as follows:
	
	##ratio = (y_radius / x_radius) * pixel_aspect_ratio##
	
	Where pixel_aspect_ratio is the ratio of the current mode width over the current mode height, assuming a 4:3 standard monitor. If aspect ratio is less than 1, radius is the x radius; if aspect is more or equal to 1, radius is the y radius.
	'f' is the fill flag. If you specify this flag, the circle/ellipse will be filled with the selected color. This has no effect if you're drawing an arc.
	
	Custom coordinates system set up by ##[[KeyPgWindow Window]]## and/or ##[[KeyPgViewgraphics View (Graphics)]]## affect the drawing operation; clipping set by ##[[KeyPgViewgraphics View]]## also applies. When ##**Circle**## finishes drawing, the current graphics cursor position is set to the supplied center.

{{fbdoc item="diff"}}
	- As the FB implementation obviously uses a different algorithm for ellipse/arc drawing than QB, the result may not be equal to QB for every pixel.
	- The F flag to draw filled circles/ellipses is new in FreeBASIC.
	- ##//target//## new to FreeBASIC
