{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
	##**Constructor**## methods are called when a user defined ##[[KeyPgType Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass Class]]## variable is created.

	##//typename//## is the name of the type for which the ##**Constructor**## method is declared and defined.  Name resolution for ##//typename//## follows the same rules as procedures when used in a ##[[KeyPgNamespace Namespace]]##.

	More than one constructor may exist for a type or class.  The exact constructor method called depends on the ##//parameter//## signature matched when the variable is initialized.  More than one ##//parameter//## may exist in a constructor method declaration.

	A constructor method is passed a hidden ##[[KeyPgThis this]]## parameter having the same type as ##//typename//##.  ##[[KeyPgThis this]]## is optionally used to access the fields of the ##[[KeyPgType Type]]## or ##[[KeyPgClass Class]]## which is to be initialized in the ##**Constructor**## method.

	Chaining of constructors in nested types is supported.  Any fields that have their own default constructor are called first.

	Constructors are called when declaring global or local static instances of ##//typename//## and when allocating ##//typename//## dynamically using the ##[[KeyPgNew New]]## operator.
