{{fbdoc item="param"}}
	##//filenum//##
		A file number of an open file or device.
	##//formatstring//##
		Format string to use.
	##//expressionlist//##
		List of items to print, seperated by commas or semi-colons.

{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
	Output various expressions to a file or device using a format determined by the ##//formatstring//## parameter. Internally, ##**Print Using**## uses a buffer size of 2048 bytes, while it is highly unlikely that this buffer would be filled, it should be noted that output would be truncated should this limit be reached.

	If no expression list is given, nothing will be output (note that the semi-colon after the format string is still necessary, even if no expression list is given).

	The format string dictates how the expressions are to be formatted when output, indicated by the use of special marker characters. There are markers for formatting both string and numeric output:

	{{fbdoc item="section" value="String formatting"}}

		{{table columns="2" cellpadding="2" cells="Marker;Formatting;!;prints the first character of a string;\   \;prints as many characters of a string as occuppied between the pair \ \;&;prints the entire string"}}

	{{fbdoc item="section" value="Numeric formatting"}}

		{{table columns="2" cellpadding="2" cells="Marker;Formatting;#;placeholder for a digit;.; placed near # indicates place for the decimal point;+;prints the sign of the number when placed to the left of numeric formatting;^^^^;prints exponential notation when placed to the right of numeric formatting"}}

	All of the special marker characters can be escaped, or preceded, with the underscore character ##"_"##, allowing them to be printed directly (##"_!"## prints ##"!"##).

	If a numerical value can't be formatted in the form indicated by the format string, the formatting is ignored and the number is printed preceded by the percent ##"%"## character. E.g., the number ##2E+200## with a ##//formatstring//## of " ""##"".""##"" " would be printed as ##"%2E+200"##.

	All other characters within the format string are printed as they appear.

	The ##**Using**## keyword is used with a different meaning with the ##[[KeyPgPalette Palette]]## graphics command
