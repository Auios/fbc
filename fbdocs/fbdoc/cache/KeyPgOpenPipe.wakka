	##//command//##
		the sub-process to execute in the operating systems command shell.
	##FOR {INPUT | OUTPUT}##
		opens the pipe in text mode for input (reading) or output (writing)
	##FOR BINARY ACCESS {READ | WRITE}##
		opens the pipe in binary mode for input (reading) or output (writing)
	##//filenum//##
		the unused file handle to associate with the opened pipe on success

{{fbdoc item="ret"}}
	When used as function, OPEN PIPE returns zero (0) on sucess and a non-zero errorcode otherwise.

{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
	This statement opens a sub-process by running ##//command//## in the operating system's shell.  The output of the sub-process can be read back to the program using standard file commands such as LINE INPUT #.  Input to the sub-process can be supplied using standard file commands such as PRINT #.  OPEN PIPE is uni-directional: the stream of data can only flow one way, either from the program to the sub-process, or from the sub-process to the program.

	##//command//## specifies the sub-process to execute and must use the standard devices stdin / stdout for its input / output.

	##FOR INPUT## allows the program to read the output (stdout) of the sub-process as a text stream
	##FOR OUTPUT## allows the program to send data as input (stdin) to the sub-process as a text stream
	##BINARY ACCESS READ## allows the program to read the output (stdout) of the sub-process as a binary stream
	##BINARY ACCESS WRITE## allows the program to send data as input (stdin) to the sub-process as a binary stream

	BINARY streams are not supported on all implementations of the C run time library.  OPEN PIPE returns with an error if it is unable to open a binary stream.

	##//filenum//## is a FB file handle that must be unused.
