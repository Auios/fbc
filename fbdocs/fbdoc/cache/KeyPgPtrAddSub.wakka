Usage of addition or subtraction on a pointer

{{fbdoc item="syntax"}}
	pointer_variable + integer_expression 
	pointer_variable - integer_expression

{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
~Pointer addition / substraction allows to move the place where a pointer points to . The resulting memory position will be pointer_variable +/- (integer_value* SIZEOF(pointed variable))

~Is up to the user to ensure the resulting pointer points to meaningful data.

%%(qbasic)Dim a(10) As Integer
Dim pa As Integer Ptr
Dim i As Integer

For i = 0 To 10
	a(i) = i 'Here we place the numbers 0 through 10 into our integer array.
Next i

pa = @a(0) 'Here we set our pointer pa to look at the first element of a.

For i = 0 To 10
	Print *pa;  'Here we print the current value at the memory address pa is looking at.
	pa += 1     'Here we tell the memory address to move ahead by one.
	'Therefore we will move pa 11 times
	'and we will print pa(0),pa(1),pa(2) etc...
Next i
