{{fbdoc item="title" value="File I/O with FreeBASIC"}}----

In FreeBASIC, there are 4 possible ways to perform file I/O:

1. Using the built-in BASIC commands like ##[[KeyPgOpen Open]]## , ##[[KeyPgGetfileio Get]]##, ##[[KeyPgPutfileio Put]]##, and ##[[KeyPgClose Close]]##. This way is mostly portable across all platforms supported by FreeBASIC. Open files are identified by "file numbers", that are specific to FreeBASIC and can't be passed into functions from bellow.

2. Using the C stream I/O functions like fopen, fread, ftell, fclose (see Stream I/O in [[ProPgCruntime C Standard Library Functions]]) of the C library FreeBASIC relies on. This is slightly faster than and adds a few features beyond method above, and still well portable. Open files are identified by file pointers, as in the C language, again unique to this access method.  The ##[[KeyPgFileattr FileAttr]]## function can be used to return a stream I/O pointer from a file number as in 1. above.

3. Using the C low-level I/O functions like _open, _read, _write, _close (see Low Level I/O in [[ProPgCruntime C Standard Library Functions]]). Those functions exist in Win32 only, code using them is not portable to any other platform.

4. Talk directly to the OS kernel (DOS: use DOS and DPMI INT's , Win32: use API calls like ""CreateFile"", ""WriteFile""). This is no longer portable. Files are identified by handles generated by and specific to the OS kernel.

This example shows and compares methods 1. and 2. described above, and reports the values returned by the functions used. It expects 2 commandline arguments, providing names of 2 **different** files with same size allows to compare the reading performance (make sure the file cache is empty before starting test) :
