{{fbdoc item="title" value="Compiling from SVN for Win32, using MSYS"}}----
If you want the very latest version of ""FreeBASIC"" on ""Win32"", it can be compiled using ""MSYS"", the Minimal SYStem put out by the ""MinGW"" people.  Most users should stay with the stable ""Win32"" build!  But the latest additions and corrections are available in this way.

		{{anchor name="setup1"}}==Install the packages for ""MinGW"" and MSYS==
		
			The packages you will need can be found on the Downloads page of [[http://www.mingw.org]].  You will need the binary versions from the "Current" or "Candidate" section (the latest versions on the page at time of writing are provided in brackets below.) These should be installed or extracted to ##C:\""MinGW""##:
				-make ([[http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/mingw32-make-3.80.0-3.exe?download mingw32-make-3.80.0-3]])
				-binutils ([[http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/binutils-2.16.91-20060119-1.tar.gz?download binutils-2.16.91]])
				-GCC-3.4 ([[http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-core-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz?download gcc-core-3.4.5]])
				-""MinGW"" Runtime ([[http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/mingw-runtime-3.9.tar.gz?download mingw-runtime-3.9]])
				-Windows API ([[http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/w32api-3.6.tar.gz?download w32api-3.6]])
			On this page you will also find an installer for MSYS ([[http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe?download MSYS-1.0.10.exe]]).  Download and install this into ##C:\msys\1.0## and run the post-install.  When prompted for your ""MinGW"" installation, type: ##c:/""MinGW""##
		
		{{anchor name="setup2"}}==Add other necessary files and packages==
			
			In order to download the FreeBASIC source code from SVN, you will need the SVN package.  This can be found at [[http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91]].  Download [[http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/38203/svn-win32-1.4.4.zip svn-win32-1.4.4.zip]] and extract the contents of the bin folder to ##C:\""MinGW""\bin##.
			
			In order to make gfxlib2, you will need ""DirectX"" header files to be installed. At the moment, the only known way to do it is to use a package like the one available here: [[http://www.streetcds.co.uk/dx/dx80_mgw.zip]].  Download and extract it to ##C:\""MinGW""##.
		
		{{anchor name="setup3"}}==Add the ""FreeBASIC"" program==
		
			(For the following steps, you will need to type these commands into an MSYS terminal.)
			You will need the latest version of ""FreeBASIC"" in order to compile fbc.exe.  It should be the last available stable version, and patched with the latest testing version, if there is one.
			This next step will assume that you have it installed in ##C:\Program Files\""FreeBASIC""##.
			
			Open up an MSYS terminal.
			In it, type the following commands:
			%%mkdir /FBbin
cp -rv "/c/Program Files/FreeBASIC"/* /FBbin%%
			This will copy ""FreeBASIC"" into your MSYS installation.  Note: If you need to find this folder on your hard disk, it should be located at ##C:\msys\1.0\FBbin\##.
			In order for MSYS to be able to find ""FreeBASIC"", you will need to add it to the path.
			Type the following command:
			%%echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/FBbin"' >> /etc/profile%%
			This adds a command to the bottom of the startup script so that next time MSYS starts it will add ##/FBbin## to your path.  You will need to restart MSYS for this to take effect.
		
	{{anchor name="making"}}===Making the ""FreeBASIC"" executable and libraries===
		
		(For the following steps, you will need to type these commands into an MSYS terminal.)
		
		{{anchor name="making1"}}==Download the ""FreeBASIC"" sources==
			
			For the latest source code, you will need to download it from ""SourceForge"" using SVN.
			MSYS rxvt I/O is often buggy, so if the system halts after you press Enter, you may then have to hold down Ctrl and press C. There is a certificate problem when executing svn and Msys will hang after you select (t) or (p). To correct this; navigate to the fbcsvn directory using a windows command prompt window and enter the svn line from below. You should be asked to select (t) or (p)when the certificate fails. If you select (p) svn will not ask again and the Msys call should work the next time. 			
			%%mkdir ~/fbcsvn
cd ~/fbcsvn
svn co https://fbc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fbc/trunk/FreeBASIC FreeBASIC%%
			
		{{anchor name="making2"}}==Make rtlib==
			
			%%cd ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/src/rtlib/obj/win32
../../configure
make CFLAGS=-O2 && make CFLAGS=-O2 MULTITHREADED=1%%
		
		{{anchor name="making3"}}==Make gfxlib==
			
			%%cd ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/src/gfxlib2/obj/win32
../../configure
make CFLAGS=-O2%%
		
		{{anchor name="making4"}}==Make fbc==
			
			Before building fbc, you may need to update your FBbin/inc folder, to make sure you are compiling fbc with the latest versions of the header files:
			%%cp -rfv ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/inc/* /FBbin/inc%%
			
			You may also be be missing some libraries - libbfd.a, libiberty.a and libintl.a - from your original build, which you will need to compile the new version of fbc. You can find them at: [[http://www.freebasic.net/temp/bfd-v2.17-win32.rar]].
			These files should go into your ##FBbin/lib/win32## folder.
			The binary distribution is typically built with cygwin and dos cross compile targets enabled.  To add additional targets, specify them on configure command line.  For information about compiler configuration options, see the INSTALL file in fbc source directory.
			
			Now enter this to build fbc:
			%%cd ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/src/compiler/obj/win32
../../configure --enable-crosscomp-cygwin --enable-crosscomp-dos
make%%
	
	{{anchor name="updating"}}===Updating the ""FreeBASIC"" software installed in MSYS===
		
		The following steps will update the copy of ""FreeBASIC"" you installed in ##/FBbin##.
		(Again, the commands should be typed into an MSYS terminal)
		
		{{anchor name="updating1"}}==Replace old files with new ones from the source folder==
			
			Update the FBbin/bin/win32 folder with any files from SVN:
			%%cp -fv ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/bin/win32/* /FBbin/bin/win32%%
			If you didn't do it earlier, you should update your FBbin/inc folder now:
			%%cp -rfv ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/inc/* /FBbin/inc%%
		
		{{anchor name="updating2"}}==Replace the old compiler and library files with the new ones you've just made==
			
			%%cp -fv ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/src/compiler/obj/win32/fbc_new.exe /FBbin/fbc.exe
cp -fv ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/src/rtlib/obj/win32/*.a /FBbin/lib/win32
cp -fv ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/src/rtlib/obj/win32/fbrt0.o /FBbin/lib/win32
cp -fv ~/fbcsvn/FreeBASIC/src/gfxlib2/obj/win32/*.a /FBbin/lib/win32%%

			

	And you're ready to roll! The newest FB is now in ##/FBbin## in your MSYS folder.
	
	Note: recently it has come to light that although the above often works, there can be chicken-and-egg-related problems. Please see this forum thread for info:
