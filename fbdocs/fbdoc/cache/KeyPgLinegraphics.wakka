	Graphics statement that draws a straight line or a box between two points. The action will take place on the current work page set via [[KeyPgScreenset ScreenSet]], or onto the buffer [[KeyPgGetgraphics Get]]/[[KeyPgPutgraphics Put]] buffer if specified.
	
	**Line** coordinates are affected by custom coordinates system set via [[KeyPgWindow Window]] and [[KeyPgViewgraphics View (Graphics)]] statements, and respect clipping rectangle set by [[KeyPgViewgraphics View (Graphics)]]. If a pair of coordinates is preceded by the ##STEP## keyword, the coordinates are assumed to be relative to the last graphics cursor position. If the ##B## flag is specified, a rectangle will be drawn instead of a line, with ##(//x1//,//y1//)-(//x2//,//y2//)## as the coordinates of the opposite rectangle corners. If ##BF## is specified, a filled rectangle will be drawn.
	
	##//Color//## denotes the color attribute, which is mode specific (see [[KeyPgColor Color]] and [[KeyPgScreengraphics Screen (Graphics)]] for details). If omitted, the current foreground color as set by the [[KeyPgColor Color]] statement is used.
	
	##//Style//##, if specified, allows styled line drawing; its value is interpreted as a 16bit bitmask, and **Line** will use it to skip pixel drawing. Starting at ##(//x1//,//y1//)##, the most significant bit of the style mask is checked: if 1, the pixel is drawn, if 0, it's skipped. This repeats for all the line pixels with the other bits, with the mask being reused when the 16 bits are all checked.

	When **Line** is used as //Line - (x, y)//, a Line is Drawn from the previous coordinate to the one specified, and no ##//x2//## or ##//y2//## parameters are needed.
