**Who I Am**
I am just the average crazed blogger who for some reason likes to write in a satirical and sarcastic way for anyone mindless enough to be reading. I am a 17-year old student, looking to go to [[http://www.umich.edu university]] next year to study what currently is looking to be Mechanical Engineering.

**What I Do**
I am an active developer in a retrospective coding group called [[http://www.apeshell.net Los Monos del Ob?s]], which has already released one game. I program in BASIC (Visual Basic, QBasic, freeBASIC), C, x86 Assembly and GML. I am also a web designer. I am proficient with XHTML 1.0 Strict, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I enjoy the challenges of making compliant sites and fast, streamlined and efficient means of communicating to the masses. I enjoy music - listening, playing and composing. I have been playing for two years, and currently enjoy playing flamenco, classical and acoustic pieces. I compose music all the time, and the day I stop learning about the guitar will be the day I can't improvise or compose something different. Outside of the house I enjoy playing squash, basketball and table tennis. I enjoy going for movies and am fine with going out to just sit and chillax.

**Contact Me**
You can get in touch with me through email (that is also my MSNIM contact) or comment on this page. I am also an active poster on [[http://forum.qbasicnews.com QBasicNews]] under the nickname aetherFox. I am also one of the members of [[http://www.apeshell.net Los Monos del Ob?s]].
