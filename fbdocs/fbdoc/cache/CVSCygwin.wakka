===Compiling from CVS for Cygwin===

At the moment, there is no standard distribution for Cygwin.  Therefore, if you wish to have a Cygwin-specific build of FreeBASIC, you'll have to build it yourself.  

	=={{anchor name="setup|Setting up the Cygwin environment"}}==
		- {{anchor name="setup1|Install the packages for Cygwin"}}
		- {{anchor name="setup3|Add the FreeBASIC program"}}

	=={{anchor name="making|Making the FreeBASIC executable and libraries"}}==
		- {{anchor name="making1|Download the FreeBASIC sources"}}
		- {{anchor name="making2|Make rtlib"}}
		- {{anchor name="making3|Make gfxlib"}}
		- {{anchor name="making4|Make fbc"}}

	=={{anchor name="updating|Updating the FreeBASIC software installed in Cygwin"}}==
		- {{anchor name="updating1|Replace the old .bi files with the new ones from the source folder"}}
		- {{anchor name="updating2|Replace the old compiler and library files with the new ones you've just made"}}
		- {{anchor name="updating3|Copy MinGW-specific library to FB linker library directory if it's not included already"}}

	{{anchor name="setup"}}===Setting up the Cygwin environment===

		{{anchor name="setup1"}}==Install the packages for Cygwin==
			You will need to have Cygwin installed with standard development tools, including:
				- gcc
				- perl 
				- cocom
				- cvs

		{{anchor name="setup3"}}==Add the ""FreeBASIC"" program==
			(For the following steps, you will need to type these commands into a Cygwin terminal.)

			%%mkdir ~/FBbin
cd ~/FBbin
cp -rv "/cygdrive/c/Program Files/FreeBASIC"/* .
echo 'export PATH=~/FBbin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc%%

			Then close the Cygwin shell window and start another.

	{{anchor name="making"}}===Making the ""FreeBASIC"" executable and libraries===
		
		(For the following steps, you will need to type these commands into a Cygwin terminal.)
		
		{{anchor name="making1"}}==Download the ""FreeBASIC"" sources==
			
			For the latest source code, you will need to download it from ""SourceForge"" using CVS.

			%%cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fbc login
mkdir ~/fbccvs
cd ~/fbccvs
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fbc co FreeBASIC
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fbc logout%%

		{{anchor name="making2"}}==Make rtlib==
			%%cd ~/fbccvs/FreeBASIC/src/rtlib
autoreconf
cd ~/fbccvs/FreeBASIC/src/rtlib/obj/cygwin
chmod +x ../../configure
../../configure
make && make MULTITHREADED=1%%

		{{anchor name="making3"}}==Make gfxlib==
			
			%%cd ~/fbccvs/FreeBASIC/src/gfxlib2/obj/cygwin
chmod +x ../../configure
../../configure
make%%
		
		{{anchor name="making4"}}==Make fbc==
			
			%%cd ~/fbccvs/FreeBASIC/src/compiler/obj/cygwin
chmod +x ../../configure
../../configure
make%%


	{{anchor name="updating"}}===Updating the ""FreeBASIC"" software installed in Cygwin===
		
		The following steps will update the copy of ""FreeBASIC"" you installed in ~/FBbin
		(Again, the commands should be typed into a Cygwin terminal)
		
		{{anchor name="updating1"}}==Replace the old .bi files with the new ones from the source folder==
			
			%%rm -rfv ~/FBbin/inc/*
cp -rfv ~/fbccvs/FreeBASIC/inc/* ~/FBbin/inc%%
		
		{{anchor name="updating2"}}==Replace the old compiler and library files with the new ones you've just made==
			
			%%cp -fv ~/fbccvs/FreeBASIC/src/compiler/obj/cygwin/fbc_new.exe ~/FBbin/fbc.exe
cp -fv ~/fbccvs/FreeBASIC/src/rtlib/obj/cygwin/*.a ~/FBbin/lib/cygwin
cp -fv ~/fbccvs/FreeBASIC/src/gfxlib2/obj/cygwin/*.a ~/FBbin/lib/cygwin%%
		
		{{anchor name="updating3"}}==Copy ""MinGW""-specific library to FB linker library directory if it's not included already==
			
			%%cp /lib/mingw/libmingwex.a ~/FBbin/lib/win32%%
	
	And you're ready to roll! The newest FB is now in your Cygwin ~/FBbin.
	
	Note: recently it has come to light that although the above often works, there can be chicken-and-egg-related problems. Please see this forum thread for info:
