{{fbdoc item="desc"}}
	Declares a pointer variable. The same as [[KeyPgPointer POINTER]].

	The operator '@' or [[KeyPgVarptr VARPTR]] are used to take the address of a variable. The '*' operator is used to dereference the pointer, that's it, access the actual value stored in the memory location the pointer is pointing at.

' Create the pointer.
Dim p As Integer Ptr

' Create an integer value that we will point to using pointer "p"
Dim num As Integer = 98845

' Point p towards the memory address that variable "num" occupies.
p = @num

' Print the value stored in memory pointed to by pointer "p"
Print "Pointer 'p' ="; *p
Print 

' Print the actual location in memory that pointer "p" points at.
