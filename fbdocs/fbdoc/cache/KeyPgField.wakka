~~A TYPE variable has its fields aligned to the word length of the system, 4 bytes presently. FIELD modifies the default alignment
to byte (FIELD 1) or two bytes (FIELD 2). This allows to use a TYPE variable to read/write files with packed data.

~-New to FreeBasic
~-Qbasic had its TYPE variables byte aligned,so FIELD=1 is needed to read binary data written by a QB program.
~-The keyword FIELD was used in QB to create a file buffer with fields variable at run time. This use is not supported in FB.
