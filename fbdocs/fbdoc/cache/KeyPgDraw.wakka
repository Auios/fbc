	Drawing will take place onto the current work page set via ##[[KeyPgScreenset ScreenSet]]## or onto the ##//target//## ##[[KeyPgGetgraphics Get]]##/##[[KeyPgPutgraphics Put]]## buffer if specified.
	The ##**Draw**## statement can be used to issue several drawing commands all at once; it is useful to quickly draw figures. The command string accepts the following commands:

	Commands to plot pixels:
	{{table columns="2" cellpadding="1" cells="Command;Description;###;Commands to plot pixels:;B;Optional prefix: move but do not draw.;N;Optional prefix: draw but do not move.;Mx,y;Move to specified screen location. if + or - precedes x, movement is relative to current cursor position.;U[n];Move n units up.
