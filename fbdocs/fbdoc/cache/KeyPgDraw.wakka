Statement for sequenced pixel plotting

{{fbdoc item="syntax"}}##
	**Draw** [//target//,] //cmd//
##
{{fbdoc item="param"}}
	##//target//##
		the buffer to draw on
	##//cmd//##
		a string containing the sequence of commands

	Drawing will take place onto the current work page set via ##[[KeyPgScreenset ScreenSet]]## or onto the ##//target//## ##[[KeyPgGetgraphics Get]]##/##[[KeyPgPutgraphics Put]]## buffer if specified.
	The ##**Draw**## statement can be used to issue several drawing commands all at once; it is useful to quickly draw figures. The command string accepts the following commands:

	Commands to plot pixels:
	{{table columns="2" cellpadding="1" cells="Command;Description;###;Commands to plot pixels:;B;Optional prefix: move but do not draw.;N;Optional prefix: draw but do not move.;M x,y;Move to specified screen location. if a '+' or '-' sign precedes x, movement is relative to current cursor position.  x's sign has no effect on the sign of y.;U [n];Move n units up.

	- FB does not currently allow sub-pixel movements: all movements are rounded to the nearest integer coordinate.
