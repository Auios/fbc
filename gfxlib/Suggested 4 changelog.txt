 - Fixed GetKey and Sleep (GeyKey now waits for keypress)
 - Screen QbScreenMode, FullScreenFlag
(if third parameter is zero or omitted, second is interpretted as the fullScreenFlag)
 - The cursor is now hidden in fullscreen modes *
 - When emulating a QB screen mode, solid background for text is turned on *

* Is this ok?
