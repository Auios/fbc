 - Fixed GetKey (now waits for keypress), which means Sleep works now
 - Screen QbScreenMode, FullScreenFlag
(if third parameter is zero or omitted, second is interpretted as the fullScreenFlag)
 - Inkey$/Getkey in graphics modes now returns the same as in console for every key on my (US English) keyboard
 - The cursor is now hidden in fullscreen modes *
 - When emulating a QB screen mode, solid background for text is turned on *
(text still has transparent background in "Screen xRes, yRes, depth" modes)
 - Pset and Point now lock the surface before calculating pixel address (fixes crashing in fullscreen)

* Is this ok?
